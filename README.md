# OSM-MUSEUM-SEARCH

### What does the program do?
In my case, it parses europ's osm data, which is about 30gb. The program looks for museums with the keyword "art" on their website and persists the valid ones.

### Why?
My girlfriend had a problem. She needed all european art museums for work, but she didn't know where to find them.
Well, clearly, there was just one solution:
- Download 30gb of osm data.
- Write a little Rust program.
- Parse the hell out of it.

In the end she was very happy and could complete here task.
Sure, maybe the program didn't catch 100%, but it was good enough for us.

The end.
