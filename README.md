# OSM-MUSEUM-SEARCH

### What?
Parse any osm data for museums with the keyword "art" on their website.

### Why?
My girlfriend had a problem. She needed all european art museums for work, but she didn't know where to find them.
Well, clearly, there was just one solution:
- Download 30gb of osm data.
- Write a little Rust program.
- Parse the hell out of it.

In the end she was very happy and we could complete "our" task.
Sure, maybe the program didn't catch 100%, but it was good enough for us.
